[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of resources dedicated to Biomedical Information Extraction (BioIE).

Inspired by [awesome-nlp](https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp). Please see that list for more resources relevant to Natural Language Processing in general.

Where possible, tools and resource entries include links to corresponding papers. These are generally links to PubMed citations unless an entry is not available in PubMed.

### Annotated Text Data
* [n2c2 (formerly i2b2) Data](https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp/) - the Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) at Harvard Medical School manages data for the National NLP Clinical Challenges and the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside challenges running since 2006. They require registration before access and use. Datasets include a variety of topics. See the [list of data challenges](https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/data-challenges/) for individual descriptions.

#### Protein-protein Interaction Annotated Corpora
Protein-protein interactions are abbreviated as PPI. The following sets are available in [BioC format](http://bioc.sourceforge.net/) and are available courtesy of the [WBI corpora repository](http://corpora.informatik.hu-berlin.de).

* [AIMed](http://corpora.informatik.hu-berlin.de/corpora/brat2bioc/aimed_bioc.xml.zip) - [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15811782) - 225 MEDLINE abstracts annotated for PPI.
